### Hello, I'm Yatin Danani
I’m a third-year Computer Science student who loves solving challenging problems through logical thinking and algorithmic design.
My journey in coding has fueled a strong interest in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) — I enjoy tackling complex problems that require creativity, precision, and performance-oriented thinking.
I primarily code in Python, a language that allows me to write clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.
Outside of academics, I’m also a passionate soccer enthusiast, which has taught me teamwork, discipline, and strategic thinking.
