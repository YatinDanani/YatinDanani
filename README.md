### Hello, I'm Yatin Danani
I’m a third-year Computer Science student passionate about solving challenging problems through logical thinking and algorithmic design.
I have a strong interest in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and enjoy tackling complex problems that demand creativity and precision.
I primarily code in Python, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.
I’m deeply motivated by the process of continuous learning and applying theory to practical, real-world coding challenges.
Outside academics, I’m a soccer enthusiast, which has strengthened my teamwork, discipline, and strategic thinking skills.
